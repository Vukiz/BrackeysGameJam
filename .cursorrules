## Factory Spawns
- Factories spawn robots automatically at random intervals
- Each factory produces only one type of robot (Painter/Welder/Electrician)
- Factory spawn timing cannot be controlled by player
- Visual indicator shows when next robot will spawn
- Factories can be placed on the map in an available factory slot when the player has received a first order for that robot type

## Rail System
- Robots move along predefined rail paths
- Player can only interact with rail switches/direction arrows
- Robot collisions result in immediate game over
- Robots follow rails in straight lines until reaching a switch or destination

## Orders/Tasks
- Orders appear randomly at workstations
- Orders have limited time to complete
- Orders require 1-3 different robot types to complete
- Three failed orders results in game over

## Game Flow
- Single game session lasts maximum 5 minutes
- Difficulty increases over time (spawn rate, order complexity)
- Score based on completed orders
- Optional bonus mechanic: Remove one stuck robot after 3 quick order completions

## Visual Style
- Top-down 3D view
- Clear distinction between robot types
- Visible rail paths and switches
- Timer and order status indicators
